*Annotation file is saved automatically whenever new image is loaded or the program quits
*Make sure to add your labels in labels.txt
*This software supports jpg, jpeg and png image format
*Check the annotation files after first few labels to make sure that the program is working correctly.
This could prevent you from labelling all images only to find that none of the annotations are being correctly saved
